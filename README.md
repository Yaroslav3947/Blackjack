## Gameplay
The objective of BlackJack 21 is to beat the dealer's hand by getting a higher score without exceeding 21. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and each card has a point value. Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are worth 10 points, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points depending on which value would be more advantageous for the player.

At the start of each round, the player places a bet and is dealt two cards. The dealer also receives two cards, but one card is face down. The player can then choose to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep their current hand. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose the round. If the player's hand is equal to or higher than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21, they win the round and receive their bet back plus an amount equal to their bet. If the player's hand is lower than the dealer's hand, they lose their bet. The start balnce is $1000
